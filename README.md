Previewing Locally
The dist directory is meant to be served by an HTTP server (unless you've configured publicPath to be a relative value), so it will not work if you open dist/index.html directly over file:// protocol. The easiest way to preview your production build locally is using a Node.js static file server, for example

```
npm install -g serve
# -s flag means serve it in Single-Page Application mode
# which deals with the routing problem below
serve -s dist
```
for deployment take refrence from 
https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html
